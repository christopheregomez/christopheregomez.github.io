Hi, I'm Chris! I am currently a fourth year B.S. Environmental Studies major at UCSB. I plan to use my academic skills for a career in environmental planning. A few hobbies of mine include free diving, going to the gym, and playing basketball, and my favorite animal is the Hawksbill Sea Turtle. Poke around my website to learn more!
