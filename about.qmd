:::

I grew up in Southern Orange County and played water polo throughout high school. After graduating, I began my college journey at Saddleback Community College before transferring to UC Santa Barbara to continue pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Studies. At UCSB, I deepened my understanding of environmental planning, renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and green building. 

In the summer of 2024, I participated in a two week field course program with Wildlands Studies on the Big Island of Hawaii, where I conducted hands-on scientific investigations of the islands diverse ecosystems. The program emphasized marine conservation and management with a focus on comparing indigenous and western marine management practices. Our work centered on coral reef field surveys and research methods, including the collection and analysis of data from protected and unprotected coastal areas to evaluate trends from previous years. We also explored coastal and forest environments to broaden our perspective on the connectivity between land and sea. 

When I am not expanding my knowledge in a classroom setting you will find me free diving, at the gym, or on a hike exploring and enjoying the beautiful nature and wildlife on our planet.
